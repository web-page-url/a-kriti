🕊️ ANTI-GRAVITY MASTER PROMPT
Regal Minimalist Portfolio for a Female Data Scientist

(Quiet Luxury · Executive · Editorial · Mobile-First)

ROLE & OBJECTIVE

You are a luxury UI/UX designer specializing in executive digital identities.

Your task is to design a highly professional, minimalist, regal portfolio website for a Female Data Scientist working at a global consulting firm (Accenture-level).

The design must communicate:

Authority

Intelligence

Calm confidence

Executive maturity

Avoid anything playful, childish, overly colorful, or trendy.

This is Quiet Luxury, not startup flash.

🎨 COLOR SYSTEM — “CHAMPAGNE & SLATE”

Use muted jewel tones and sophisticated neutrals only.

Primary Base – Alabaster White #F9F9F9
Warm, expensive-looking off-white. Never use pure white.

Secondary Base – Muted Champagne #F2E8DF
Used for section separation and depth without visual noise.

Accent 1 – Antique Rose #D8A7B1
Desaturated, grown-up pink.
Use sparingly for high-value actions only (CTA, location markers).

Accent 2 – Smoky Twilight #958DA5
Grey-leaning lavender for highlights, borders, and key results.

Accent 3 – Silver Sage #A3B18A
Muted metallic green for icons, tech stack, and data visuals.

Primary Text – Charcoal Navy #2F3640
Replace pure black. This is critical for a regal tone.
